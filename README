This is a 3D game/demo of an OpenGL graphics engine. Some parts of the code were taken from various sources and cited as appropriate.

It requires ImageMagick, OpenGL, GLUT, and a unix variant (it might work elsewhere, haven't tried).

To run:

1. Generate skybox textures: read skybox/readme.txt for instructions
2. Compile: gcc cube-eater.c cube.c simulation.c skybox.c spaceship.c vecops.c -lglut -o cube
3. Run ./cube !
